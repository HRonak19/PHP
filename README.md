# Introduction to PHP

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular open-source server-side scripting language designed for web development. It is especially suited for creating dynamic and interactive websites.

## Key Features

- **Server-Side Execution**: PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is sent to the browser as plain HTML.
- **Embedded in HTML**: PHP can be embedded directly into HTML, making it easy to integrate with web pages.
- **Cross-Platform**: PHP runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and supports most major web servers (Apache, Nginx, IIS).
- **Database Integration**: PHP supports a wide range of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.
- **Extensive Community Support**: A large developer community and rich ecosystem of frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter.

## Basic Example

```php
<?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>
